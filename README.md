# redqueue

This project aims to implement a fast, lightweight and simple STOMP
compatible messaging server.

There are quite a few STOMP servers available already but all of them
are either heavyweight or experimental.

It uses libevent for networking and leveldb for storing messages.


# current status

The original environment for which redqueue was designed has changed
so it's development was stopped. The code is still there for reference
or someone to pick up the work. The basic functionality is already working.
